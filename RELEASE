RELEASE NOTES

ScalaCheck 1.1.1

Author: Rickard Nilsson (rickard.nilsson@telia.com)

ScalaCheck is a Scala implementation of the QuickCheck 2 library for Haskell.
It tries to keep the look and feel of QuickCheck as much as possible, while
being open for improvements and extensions that can ease the task of
property-based, randomized testing of Scala programs.

The main features of ScalaCheck is:

  * Unit properties are written directly in Scala, using combinators
    from the ScalaCheck library.

  * Properties are tested automatically, with test data generated by
    ScalaCheck. Data generation can be precisely controlled, and generation
    of custom data types is simple to define.

  * Failing test cases are minimised automatically, which makes pin-pointing
    error causes easier.

  * Support for stateful testing of command sequences, and minimization of
    failing command sequences.


This release introduce no changes at all since ScalaCheck 1.1, it is just a
rebuild of the library using Scala 2.6.1, since ScalaCheck 1.1 proved to be
binary incompatible with Scala 2.6.1. Please upgrade to ScalaCheck 1.1.1 if you
are using Scala 2.6.1. For more information on what was introduced in
ScalaCheck 1.1, see the previous release notes below.


ScalaCheck availability:

  * Direct installation with sbaz:

    sbaz update
    sbaz install scalacheck

    If you already have an earlier version of ScalaCheck installed, you
    just need to run:

    sbaz upgrade

ScalaCheck 1.1

Author: Rickard Nilsson (rickard.nilsson@telia.com)

ScalaCheck is a Scala implementation of the QuickCheck 2 library for Haskell.
It tries to keep the look and feel of QuickCheck as much as possible, while
being open for improvements and extensions that can ease the task of
property-based, randomized testing of Scala programs.

The main features of ScalaCheck is:

  * Unit properties are written directly in Scala, using combinators
    from the ScalaCheck library.

  * Properties are tested automatically, with test data generated by
    ScalaCheck. Data generation can be precisely controlled, and generation
    of custom data types is simple to define.

  * Failing test cases are minimised automatically, which makes pin-pointing
    error causes easier.

  * Support for stateful testing of command sequences, and minimization of
    failing command sequences.


This release introduces minor functionality improvements, some new helper
methods and arbitrary generators for some new types. It also has (experimental)
support for stateful command sequence testing (in a state machine fashion Ã  la
Erlang QuickCheck), with the new trait scalacheck.Commands. Please see the last
section of the User Guide for more information on this library. Also remember
that the library interface probably will change in future releases.

The sbaz package has been improved in this release, with sources and api
documentation added.

NOTE: The ScalaCheck root package has been CHANGED from just 'scalacheck' to
'org.scalacheck'. The trait Testable has been renamed to Properties.

From now on, ScalaCheck will also be available in the Maven repository at
scala-tools.org. See further details below.

ScalaCheck 1.0

ScalaCheck is a Scala implementation of the QuickCheck 2 library for Haskell.
It tries to keep the look and feel of QuickCheck as much as possible, while
being open for improvements and extensions that can ease the task of
property-based, randomized testing of Scala programs.

The main features of ScalaCheck is:

  * Unit properties are written directly in Scala, using combinators
    from the ScalaCheck library.

  * Properties are tested automatically, with test data generated by
    ScalaCheck. Data generation can be precisely controlled, and generation
    of custom data types is simple to define.

  * Failing test cases are minimised automatically, which makes pin-pointing
    error causes easier.


This release does not add any major new functionality since the 1.0-RC1 release,
but some bugs have been fixed and the code has been cleaned up a bit. Also,
this release depends on Scala 2.6.0, since it uses some of its new features.

ScalaCheck 1.0-RC1

ScalaCheck is a Scala implementation of the QuickCheck 2 library for Haskell.
It tries to keep the look and feel of QuickCheck as much as possible, while
being open for improvements and extensions that can ease the task of
property-based, randomized testing of Scala programs.

The main feature that release 1.0-RC1 adds is test case minimisation, or
shrinking, which is a feature also found in QuickCheck 2. Moreover, ScalaCheck
has been refactored and stabilised, and is soon ready for a 1.0 release.
Also, a User Guide has been written which can be found on the project site.

ScalaCheck 0.2

ScalaCheck is a Scala implementation of the QuickCheck library for Haskell.
It tries to keep the look and feel of QuickCheck as much as possible, while
being open for improvements and extensions that can ease the task of
property-based, randomized testing of Scala programs.

Release 0.2 adds several bug fixes and some improvements. The most noteworthy
new feature is the Testable trait, which makes it easy to define and check
a batch of properties, directly in the implementing code if desired.

ScalaCheck 0.1

ScalaCheck is a Scala implementation of the QuickCheck library for Haskell.
It tries to keep the look and feel of QuickCheck as much as possible, while
being open for improvements and extensions that can ease the task of
property-based, randomized testing of Scala programs.

This is an early release of ScalaCheck, with basic functionality. Most of
the generator and property combinators from QuickCheck are implemented, as
well as a basic checker function that prints results to the console in
QuickCheck-style. There are default generators for integers, characters,
strings, booleans, and lists ans tuples over arbitrary types.
