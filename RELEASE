RELEASE NOTES

ScalaCheck 0.2

ScalaCheck is a Scala implementation of the QuickCheck library for Haskell.
It tries to keep the look and feel of QuickCheck as much as possible, while
being open for improvements and extensions that can ease the task of
property-based, randomized testing of Scala programs.

Release 0.2 adds several bug fixes and some improvements. The most noteworthy
new feature is the Testable trait, which makes it easy to define and check
a batch of properties, directly in the implementing code if desired.

ScalaCheck 0.1

ScalaCheck is a Scala implementation of the QuickCheck library for Haskell.
It tries to keep the look and feel of QuickCheck as much as possible, while
being open for improvements and extensions that can ease the task of
property-based, randomized testing of Scala programs.

This is an early release of ScalaCheck, with basic functionality. Most of
the generator and property combinators from QuickCheck are implemented, as
well as a basic checker function that prints results to the console in
QuickCheck-style. There are default generators for integers, characters,
strings, booleans, and lists ans tuples over arbitrary types.
